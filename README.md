# DeltaHacks3

OUR FIRST HACKATHON (by Graeme Woods, Linnea Campbell, Steven, Abrar Ahsan)
Our Site: http://graemewoods.me/ourhamilton/

AIM: increase the participation and involvement of the people living in Hamilton, so they could volunteer in events and be part of the community. This was part of the 'OUR FUTURE HAMILTON' Challange which is hosted by the city of Hamilton.

FEATURES:
- RSS FEED from cbc news.com
- Google Maps API of Hamilton City
- Twitter Feed
- Google Form
- Bootstrap

Future Expansion Plans: 
- Use database to store all the events submitted into the form (nstead of using google forms)
- HTTP GET Request from the database / JSON file and display it in the web page as a feed
- Make Account Based System (You can see who participate in an event / profile of individual's participation histories)
- Spread to more cities! (Our Hamilton, Our Toronto, Our Waterloo, etc...)
